Task formulation
1. Place this binary tree in the computer memory (see below, the job number corresponds to the last digit of the code), fill the data in the vertices with random numbers.
2. Write procedures for calculating the size of a tree, the height of a tree, the average height of a tree, and the checksum for a tree and test their operation using a specific example.
3. Program the traversal of a binary tree from left to right and display the resulting sequence of data on the screen.
